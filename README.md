## 📦 Installing

### Arch Linux

Read this first:

>  [!IMPORTANT]
> It is strongly recommended to back up your system with a tool like `timeshift` or `snapper` first.

> [!NOTE]
> The install script assumes you already installed Arch. It doesn't install any hardware stuff like NVIDIA drivers, network etc. It assumes you already handled that.

> [!NOTE]
> The install script will automatically back up all of the necessary files, but i recommend backing them up one more time manually, just in case. I'm not responsible for lost files or broken systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always check what a script does before running it.

You need `curl`

To install swaydots on Arch Linux, paste this into your terminal:

```bash
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RIOTLaF/swaydots-for-artix/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

### Other

Install script is only available for Arch-based systems at the moment. Sorry :-(

## 🖼️ Previews

See them here - [Previews](https://github.com/aceydot/swaydots/wiki/Previews)

## 🎨 Themes

Currently, 5 themes are available:

- Catppuccin-Macchiato

- Nord
- Rose-pine-Dark

## 🚨 For everyone

The dotfiles should work out of the box, but I can't guarantee it.

Note: they are configured to work on systems without scaling. If you have any problems, please open an issue.

## 🚨 For laptop users

Since I don't own a laptop, i can't confirm whether the backlight and battery modules in waybar work 100%.

If you want, you can give me feedback on whether they work.
